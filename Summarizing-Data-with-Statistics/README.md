### Project Overview

 The rise of superheroes and supervillains is at an all time high. The 'Academy of Super Beings(ASB)' was formed to bring order to it. We have with us the data of more than 500 super humans but we need your knowledge of descriptive statistics in figuring out the important insights from it.


### Learnings from the project

 After doing this project, one will have a better grip on the applications of descriptive statistics. In this project, we learned about the following concepts:

Bar plotting
Boxplot plotting
Pie-chart plotting
Subplot operations
Feature Correlation
IQR operations


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Some interesting insights were to be removed from the dataset for which the following procedures were adopted -
1.Firstly the data in pandas dataframe was loaded.
2.Pie-chart showing heroes alignment(good,bad,neutral) were plotted.
3.Correlation between attributes Strength - Combat and Intelligence - Combat, to determine which pair is more correlated using pearson's correlation co-efficient were found.
4.the list of most powerful superhero/villian were found.
5.Certain attributes like Speed,Power and intelligence(by plotting box-plot) was shown.


### Challenges faced

 - To identify which  of correlation co-effecient(Pearson or Spearman) and drawing conclusion based on it.
By refering to theory of both of them.


### Additional pointers

 Thorough understanding of following concepts is required:
Bar plotting
Boxplot plotting
Pie-chart plotting
Subplot operations
Feature Correlation
IQR operations
