### Project Overview

 Using Decision Tree model, classify whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full.
In this project we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back. The data that we have is from 2007-2010.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, one will have a better understanding of how to build a decision tree model. In this project, we will apply the following concepts.

Train-test split, Correlation between the features, Decision Tree Modeling, Evaluation Metrics and Graphviz plotting.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 1. Data loading and splitting the data into training and test sets.
2. Calculate the distribution of target variable "paid.back.loan" and plot its barplot to visualize the distribution.
3. Some feature engineering plus splitting the features based on the data type for visualization purposes.
4. Numerical Features Visualisation with respet to target variable.
5. Categorical Features Visualisation with respet to target variable.
6. Train data with Decision Tree and find its accuracy.
7. Check if pruning of decision tree improves its accuracy. Prune the Decision Tree model using Grid Search and find out its accuracy. 
8.  Visualise pruned decision tree using graphviz.
