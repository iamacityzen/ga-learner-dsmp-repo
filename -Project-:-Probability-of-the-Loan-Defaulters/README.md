### Project Overview

 In this project, we will be exploring the publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). As an investor one would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying the amount back. Our main aim is tofind what is the probability that the borrower paid back their loan in full?


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, we will have a better understanding of probability. In this project, we will apply the following concepts.

Independency check,
Bayes theorem,
Visualizing discrete variable,
Visualizing continuous variable.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 1.  Calculate the joint probability it's very important that conditions are independent of each other. Les's check whether the condition 'fico' credit score is 
     greater than 700 and column 'purpose' == 'debt_consolidation'
2.  Calculating conditional probability and calculation of Bayes theorem for the probability of 'credit policy' is 'yes' and the person 
     is given the loan.
3.  Visualize the bar plot for the feature purpose where 'paid.back.loan' == No.
4.  Plotting the histogram for visualization of the continuous variable to get the basic idea about how the distribution of continuous variables looks like.
