### Project Overview

 The project is for stakeholders of Dream Housing Finance company to help them get visual insights on the company's operations. Using the data visualization techniques that we have learned, we will help them visualise the data and see if we can help the stakeholders arrive at some inference based on the visual plots.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project,  we will have a better understanding of data visualization techniques. In this project, we will be applying the following concepts:

Bar plotting,
Scatter plotting,
Kernel Density plotting,
Subplot operations,
Axes modifications.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 1. Visualized the company's record with respect to loan approvals by plotting bar graph of 'Loan_Status' column of dataset.
2. Visualized the  the loan approval distribution across the regions for the stakeholders by plotting unstacked bar graph of 'Property_Area' and   
     'Loan_Status' columns of dataset.
3. Visualized the loan approval with respect to Educational qualification which gave insight that more Graduates apply for loan and it gets approved. 
     This was also achieved  by plotting unstacked bar graph 'Education' and 'Loan_Status columns' of dataset.
4. Visualised the loan amount distributed among Graduated and non-Graduates by using density plot.
5.  Plotted a scatter plot between 'LoanAmount' and the different types of Income (ApplicantIncome, CoapplicantIncome and TotalIncome) to check 
     for  correlation between 'TotalIncome' and 'LoanAmount'.
