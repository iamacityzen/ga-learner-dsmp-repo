### Project Overview

 Conduct an EDA on the Google Play Store data and try to explore whether given the data, ratings of an can be predicted.
Google Play Store serves as the official app store for the Android operating system, allowing users to browse and download applications. Success of an app is largely determined by its ratings.
But is there any particular pattern among high rated apps? Does size or genre of the app play a role in determining its high rating?



### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, one will have a better understanding of certain methods of EDA and Data Preprocessing. In this project, i have will applied the following concepts.

Removing Missing Values,
Cleaning Data,
Exploring Data through various plots.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 1. Data Loading and plotting the histogram of  rating column.
2. Treating null values by analysing the percentage of null values in every column.
3. Exploring,Comparing 'Rating' and 'Category' columns together on a boxplot.
4. Exploring,Cleaning the 'Installs' column and compared it with 'Ratings' and observe correlation between them.
5. Exploring.Cleaning the 'Price' column and compared it with 'Ratings' and observe correlation between them.
6. Exploring,Cleaning the 'Genre' column and compared it with 'Ratings' and observe correlation between them.
7. Exploring,Cleaning the 'Last Updated' column and compared it with 'Ratings' and observe correlation between them.. 


### Additional pointers

  Is the data clean enough that it can be fed to an ML Model?

* Are the data features sufficient enough for us to create an ML model to predict ratings of an app?

* If given the data to you by a firm, what other use cases do you think can be made from it?
