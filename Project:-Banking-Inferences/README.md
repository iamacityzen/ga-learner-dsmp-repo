### Project Overview

 Bank Of New York wants to expand its branches and for that, it has a certain hypothesis and statements it wants to verify. Using the inferential statistics method that we have learned, help the bank. 


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to use inferential statistics. In this project, we will apply the following concepts:

Confidence Interval,

Central Limit Theorem,

Hypothesis Testing,

Chi-Square Test.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 1.  loading data and finding the confidence interval.
2. Finding out if Central Limit Theorem holds for 'installment' column
3. Check for one sided hypothesis(μ= 12 %)  that people with purpose as 'small_business' have been given int.rate more due to the risk assosciated.
     If 'p-value is less than 0.05, you can reject the null hypothesis, If 'p-value is greater than 0.05, you can't reject the null hypothesis,
4. Check for one sided hypothesis (μ = There is no difference) that monthly installments (installment) customers might have to pay some sort of effect  
    on loan defaulters.
5. Bank suspects is that there is a strong association between purpose of the loan(purpose column) of a person and whether that person has paid back 
    loan ('paid.back.loan' column). Since both are categorical columns, we will do chi-square test to test the same.
    If chi-squared statistic exceeds the critical value, reject the null hypothesis that the two distributions are the same, else null hypothesis cannot be   
    rejected
