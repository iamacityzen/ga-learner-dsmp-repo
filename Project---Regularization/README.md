### Project Overview

 Armed with your new-found expertise in regularization, let's work on the Melbourne housing data using regularized regression. Each observation is a different house attribute with various features, like the number of properties that exist in the suburb, land size, building size, governing council for the area, real estate agent, price of the house, etc. and  apply a Regularization model for predicting house prices in Melbourne. And compare the results with linear regression and cross validation.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of how to build a regularized regression model. In this project, you will apply the following concepts.

Train-test split, 
Correlation between the features, 
Linear Regression, 
Polynomial Regressor, 
Lasso Regressor, 
Ridge Regressor, 
R^2 score, 
Evaluation Metrics.


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 1. Data Loading and Splitting.
2. Prediction Using Linear regression and  check the model performance using r^2 score.
3. Prediction Using Lasso and  check the model performance using r^2 score. Check for performance improvement in prediction.
4. Prediction Using Ridge and  check the model performance using r^2 score. Check for performance improvement in prediction.
5. Prediction Using Cross-Validation, using cv = 10 and find the mean score.
6. Prediction Using Polynomial Regressor, generate second-degree polynomial features and check r^2 score.
